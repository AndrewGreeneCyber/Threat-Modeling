<h1>Threat Modeling</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project applied the PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) methodology to ensure secure interactions and protect user data in a sneaker company's app. The business objectives focused on seamless connection, privacy, and multiple secure payment options. The technical scope included APIs, PKI, AES encryption, SHA-256, and SQL. The threat analysis identified internal threats from malicious insiders and external threats like SQL injection attacks. Vulnerabilities included improper input validation and insufficient database encryption. Attack modeling revealed potential exploits such as SQL injection and man-in-the-middle attacks. Risk analysis and impact recommended input validation, database encryption, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and regular penetration testing to mitigate risks and improve security.
